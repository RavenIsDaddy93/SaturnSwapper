# Saturn
This branch of this repo contains the code to the Saturn Version Virtual Launcher! We are not supplying the codebase towards the actual virtualization of Fortnite at the moment due to security, legal, and theft concerns.

## What is Saturn?
Saturn is the most advanced Unreal Engine modding tool. We natively ship with the ability to mod Fortnite - as that is the most popular Unreal Engine game at the moment - but will provide help for modifying it towards another game.

Official Get-Started Page: NOT AVAILABLE YET
